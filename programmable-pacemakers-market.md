<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Programmable Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber Pacemakers</li><li>Dual Chamber Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Programmable pacemakers come in two main types: single chamber pacemakers and dual chamber pacemakers. Single chamber pacemakers are implanted with only one lead to regulate either the atrium or ventricle of the heart. On the other hand, dual chamber pacemakers have two leads that regulate both the atrium and ventricle, allowing for more natural heart rhythm synchronization. Each type offers different benefits and is chosen based on the specific needs of the patient.</p></p>
