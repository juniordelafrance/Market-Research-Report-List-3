<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Life Support Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Venoarterial (VA) ECMO</li><li>Venovenous (VV) ECMO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal Life Support Devices provide temporary mechanical support for patients with severe heart and/or lung failure. There are two main types of ECMO: Venoarterial (VA) ECMO, which provides support to both the heart and the lungs, and Venovenous (VV) ECMO, which provides support only to the lungs. VA ECMO is used in cases of cardiac failure, while VV ECMO is used in cases of respiratory failure. Both types of ECMO help maintain oxygenation and circulation in critically ill patients while their heart and/or lungs recover.</p></p>
