<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Video Laryngoscopy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Channelled Video Laryngoscopy</li><li>Unchannelled Video Laryngoscopy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Channelled Video Laryngoscopy involves a channel in the device that guides the endotracheal tube into the trachea during intubation, making the procedure easier and more efficient. This type is preferred in difficult airway scenarios. On the other hand, Unchannelled Video Laryngoscopy does not have a channel and requires a separate tool to insert the endotracheal tube, which may be more challenging but offers more flexibility in terms of tube size and shape. Both types of video laryngoscopy have their own advantages and are utilized based on the specific requirements of the procedure.</p></p>
