<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cloud-native Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Public Cloud</li><li>Private Cloud</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cloud-native software can be categorized into two main market types: Public Cloud and Private Cloud. Public Cloud services are provided by third-party providers over the internet, enabling users to access and use resources on a pay-as-you-go basis. On the other hand, Private Cloud services are dedicated to a single organization and are maintained either on-premises or by a third-party provider. Both types offer scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, but Private Cloud provides greater control and security for organizations with specific regulatory or compliance requirements.</p></p>
