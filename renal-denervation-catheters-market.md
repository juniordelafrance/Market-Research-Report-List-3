<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Renal Denervation Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disposable</li><li>Non Disposable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Renal Denervation Catheters are medical devices used in the treatment of high blood pressure. There are two types of market for these catheters based on their usage - Disposable and Non-Disposable. Disposable catheters are designed for single-use only and are discarded after each procedure, making them more convenient and reducing the risk of infection. Non-Disposable catheters can be reused multiple times but require thorough cleaning and sterilization between uses. Both types of catheters have their own advantages and are used based on the specific requirements of the procedure.</p></p>
