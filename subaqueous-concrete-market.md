<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Subaqueous Concrete Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Organic Cementitious Material Concrete</li><li>Inorganic Cementitious Material Concrete</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Subaqueous concrete refers to concrete structures that are placed underwater. Two main types of subaqueous concrete are organic cementitious material concrete and inorganic cementitious material concrete. Organic cementitious material concrete is made from materials such as wood, cotton, and rubber, which can biodegrade over time. In contrast, inorganic cementitious material concrete is made from traditional cementitious materials like Portland cement, sand, and gravel, which provide longer-lasting and more durable structures underwater. Both types play a crucial role in marine construction projects.</p></p>
