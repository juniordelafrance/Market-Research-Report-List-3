<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Doppler Blood Flow Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable</li><li>Non-implanted</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Doppler blood flow monitor market can be divided into implantable and non-implanted types. Implantable monitors are surgically implanted inside the body to provide continuous monitoring of blood flow. They are typically used in critical care settings or for long-term monitoring of chronic conditions. Non-implanted monitors are external devices that are placed on the skin to measure blood flow non-invasively. These are more commonly used in outpatient settings or for short-term monitoring during procedures. Both types serve the same purpose of monitoring blood flow but differ in their method of placement and duration of use.</p></p>
