<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diffusion Furnace Heating Elements Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Heater</li><li>Horizontal Heater</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diffusion furnace heating elements are used in semiconductor manufacturing for the controlled heating of wafers. Two common types of heating elements are vertical and horizontal heaters. Vertical heaters have a heating element that runs vertically along the walls of the furnace, providing even heating from top to bottom. Horizontal heaters have a heating element that runs horizontally across the bottom of the furnace, providing uniform heating across the wafer surface. Each type has its own advantages and is chosen based on specific manufacturing requirements.</p></p>
