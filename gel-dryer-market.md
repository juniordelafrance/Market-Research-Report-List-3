<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gel Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Evaporation (Air-Drying) Systems</li><li>Vacuum Drying Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passive Evaporation (Air-Drying) Systems involve drying gels by allowing them to air dry at room temperature over a period of time. This method is simple and cost-effective but can be time-consuming. Vacuum Drying Systems, on the other hand, use a vacuum pump to remove moisture from gels more rapidly and efficiently. While this method may be more expensive than passive evaporation systems, it is faster and can produce better results in terms of gel drying.</p></p>
