<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seawater Cooling Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Seawater Cooling Pump market comprises two main types: Centrifugal Pumps and Positive Displacement Pumps. Centrifugal pumps are most commonly used due to their ability to efficiently move large volumes of seawater. They work by converting rotational energy from a motor into kinetic energy to move the fluid. Positive displacement pumps, on the other hand, operate by trapping a specific volume of fluid and then forcing it into the system at a constant flow rate. Both types are essential in cooling systems for various industrial applications.</p></p>
